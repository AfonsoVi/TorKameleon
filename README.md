## TorKameleon

TorKameleon is a solution designed to protect Tor users with increased censorship resistance against powerful traffic correlation attacks carried out by global adversaries. The system is based on flexible K-anonymization input circuits that can support TLS tunneling and WebRTC-based covert channels before forwarding users' original input traffic to the Tor network. Our goal is to protect users from correlation attacks through machine learning between incoming user traffic and the observed traffic at different Tor network intermediate relays or outgoing traffic to destinations. TorKameleon is the first system to implement a Tor pluggable transport based on both parameterizable TLS tunneling or WebRTC media as covert channels. We have implemented the TorKameleon prototype and performed extensive validations to observe the correctness and experimental performance of the proposed solution in the Tor environment.
